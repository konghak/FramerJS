# Scrollable Template
This template highlights how to turn a list of images, imported from Sketch, into a scrollable feed.

## Get started
1. Drag the ‘Scrollable.framer’ folder to Framer Studio.
2. Open the ‘Scrollable.sketch’ file in Sketch Beta 3.3.
3. Have a look at the layer hierarchy in Sketch. Our static content is made scrollable with one line of code, because the height of the images exceeds that of its parent layer.
4. The prototype also includes a little blurring effect on the navigation bar, simply by copying imported images in Framer.

### Importing in Framer
With Framer, you can bring your designs to life using tools you’re already comfortable with. If you’re not familiar with Importing, have a look at our [Importing Guide](http://framerjs.com/learn/import/).
