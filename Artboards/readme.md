# Artboards Template
This template highlights how to create a swiping interaction between different Artboards, imported from Sketch. It also included a persistent navigation bar.

## Get started
1. Drag the ‘Artboards.framer’ folder to Framer Studio.
2. Open the ‘Artboards.sketch’ file in Sketch 3.
3. Have a look at the document set-up in Sketch. We’re using 3 different Artboards, each with different contents.
4. The Artboards are positioned and made draggable within Framer.
5. We’re also adjusting the parent layer of our navigation bar to turn it into a persistently positioned item within our prototype.

### Importing in Framer
With Framer, you can bring your designs to life using tools you’re already comfortable with. If you’re not familiar with Importing, have a look at our [Importing Guide](http://framerjs.com/learn/import/).
